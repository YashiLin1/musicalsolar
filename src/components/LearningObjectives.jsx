            Break a problem down into smaller parts to solve it! When you break complex rhythms into
            single beat to solve it and
            recognize pattern of the planets, you are developing the skill!
            Using logical reasoning to solve problems is a fundamental mindset
            in Computer Science!

            Arranging commands in a specific order is crucial in Computer
            Science. To create a specific rhythm pattern for the planets, you
            adjust the planet properties (Name, Orbit, Orbit Time, Direction,
            and Start Degree) accordingly within a fixed condition (planet cross
            string) to achieve the desired outcomes.

          <p className="text-lg font-light text-gray-200 max-w-3xl leading-[2rem] ">
            There are different combinations to create the same rhythms. Being
            creative is important in Computer Science! The key to composing lies
            in your perspective. Try to understand how the rhythm is affected
            when the String is not at 0Â° degree, or when direction is
            counterclockwise
